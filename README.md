# SportsStore

The SportsStore application implements the project of an online store.
It contains a product catalog that can be browsed by category, a shopping cart to which the user can
add products and remove them, as well as the screen with the checkout function, where you can also enter
shipping information. It also has an administration module that performs functions
create, view, update and delete (CRUD). The directory is protected so that only logged in administrators can make changes.
